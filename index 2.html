    <h3>His Asceticism</h3>
<p>
    Umar (R.A.) was most humble to Allah and led an austere life. His food was very coarse and he would patch his cloth with leather.  He used to carry a water skin on his shoulders in spite of his great esteem.  He used to laugh little and never joked with anyone.  Engraved on his ring was: "Death is sufﬁcient as an admonition, O' Umar."

When he was appointed as the Caliph, he said: "Nothing is permissible (for me) from the treasury more than two clothes, one for the cold season and the other for the dry season. The sustenance of my family will be the equivalent of an average man of Quraish and not the rich amongst them, for I am just an ordinary man among the Muslims (i.e. nothing special about me)."

    Muawiyah ibn Abu Sufian (R.A.) said: "As for Abu Bakr (R.A.), he never desired the world and the world did not desire him. As for Umar, the world desired him but he never desired the world. As for us, we have been soiled by the world inside-out."

At the time of drought, Umar (R.A.) ate bread and oil until his skin turned pale dark and he would say: "What a bad leader I am if I eat my ﬁll and the people go hungry."

    <h3>His Appointment as Caliph and Successor of Abu Bakr (R.A.)</h3>
<p>
    When Abu Bakr's (R.A.) sickness grew intense, the people gathered around him and he said:

    "There has befallen me what you see and I think I am going to die soon. Allah has freed you from your oath of alliance to me, and your oath is no longer binding. Your affairs are in your hands, so appoint over you whomever you like. If you appoint someone whilst I am still alive, I think it is less likely that you will become divided after I am gone." 

The Companions consulted one another, each of them trying to refuse the position of Caliph for himself and seeking it for his brother whom he thought was ﬁt and qualiﬁed for it. Hence they came back to him and said:

    "We have decided to leave it to you, O' Successor of the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W.)." 

    He said: "Give me time so that I may choose someone who will be most pleasing to Allah, most protective of His religion and His slaves.”

So he looked out over the people and said to them:

    "Do you accept the one whom I appoint as your leader? For by Allah I have tried to appoint the best; I have not appointed a relative. I have appointed as your leader Umar ibn Al-Khattab, so listen to him and obey." 

    Companions said: "We will listen and obey." 

Then Abu Bakr (R.A.) turned in supplicating to Allah, expressing his concern to his Lord. He said:

    "I have appointed him not by the command of Your Prophet, seeking nothing but what is in their best interests. I fear sedition for them and I have thought long and hard about the matter. I have appointed over them the best of them and the one who is keenest to lead them in the right way. Now here I am with Your decree about to be fulﬁlled. Take care of them after I am gone for they are Your salves."

Umar Ibn Al-Khattab (R.A.) started to act as the caliph of the Muslims as soon as Abu Bakr (R.A.) passed away.

The above conversation clearly shows that Abu Bakr's (R.A.) nomination of Umar ibn Al- Khattab (R.A.) as caliph was based on the consent of the majority of the Companions (R.A.). Hence, we see that the appointment of Umar (R.A.) was done in accordance with the soundest and fair principles of Consultation (Shura). Hence, Umar (R.A.) succeeded Abu Bakr (R.A.) as a second Caliph on Monday, 22nd of Jumada Al-Akhirah, 13th AH (August 23rd, 634 AD).

    <h3>His Reign as Caliph</h3>
<p>
    He was the ﬁrst Caliph to be nominated as "Prince of the Believers".  His achievements, during his reign as Caliph, are so many and cannot be mentioned in this article. However, following are some highlights of his accomplishments during the tenure of his ‘Khilafat’:

1.He is the one who founded the Lunar Calendar (Hijri Year i-e according to the date of Prophet Mohammad's (S.A.W.) migration to Medinah).

2. In his era Islam gained a great position, as the Islamic Empire expanded at an unprecedented rate ruling the whole Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Tripoli, Persia, Khurassan, Eastern Anatolia, South Armenian and Sajistan. Jerusalem (first Qiblah) was conquered during his reign alongwith the whole Sassanid Persian Empire and two thirds of the Eastern Roman Empire.

3. Introduction and implementation of different Political and civil administration jobs such as Chief Secretary (Khatib), Military Secretary (Khatib ud Diwan), Revenue Collector (Sahib ul Kharaj), Police Chief (Sahib ul Ahdath), Treasury Officer (Sahib Bait-ul-Maal) and many other official posts.

4. Umar (R.A.) was the first to establish a special department for the investigation of complaints against the officers of the State.

5. Umar (R.A.) was the first to introduce the public ministry system, where the records of officials and soldiers were kept. He was also the first person ever to appoint police forces to keep civil order. Another important aspect of Umar's (R.A.) rule was that he banned any of his governors/officials from engaging in trade or any sort of business dealings whilst being in a position of power.
